    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There is macaroni and cheese, and then there is 
        special occasion macaroni and cheese like this 
        one. Unlike most recipes, which start with a 
        roux, this one begins with a milk-and-egg base,
         which gives the dish an incredibly rich, silky
        taste. It’s adapted from Millie Peartree, the
        owner of Millie Peartree Fish Fry & Soul Food
        restaurant in the Bronx, who has been making this
        dish since she was a little girl. The recipe was
        passed down in her family for generations, but 
        because of the generous amount of cheese used, 
        the dish was only made for events like Christmas 
        and Thanksgiving. Extra-sharp Cheddar adds 
        tartness and a layer of Colby Jack creates a 
        gooey, molten center. If you can’t find a Colby 
        Jack blend, shredded mozzarella or a 
        Mexican-style blend will work in its place.</p>
