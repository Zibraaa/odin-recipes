    <h1>Mac'n'Cheese</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There is macaroni and cheese, and then there is 
        special occasion macaroni and cheese like this 
        one. Unlike most recipes, which start with a 
        roux, this one begins with a milk-and-egg base,
         which gives the dish an incredibly rich, silky
        taste. It’s adapted from Millie Peartree, the
        owner of Millie Peartree Fish Fry & Soul Food
        restaurant in the Bronx, who has been making this
        dish since she was a little girl. The recipe was
        passed down in her family for generations, but 
        because of the generous amount of cheese used, 
        the dish was only made for events like Christmas 
        and Thanksgiving. Extra-sharp Cheddar adds 
        tartness and a layer of Colby Jack creates a 
        gooey, molten center. If you can’t find a Colby 
        Jack blend, shredded mozzarella or a 
        Mexican-style blend will work in its place.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients (Serves 8-10)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded extra-sharp Cheddar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Colby Jack</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 350 degrees. Bring a large 
            pot of generously salted water to a boil. 
            Add macaroni and cook according to package 
            directions until a little under al dente, 
            about 4 minutes. Transfer to a colander 
            and rinse under cold water to stop cooking. 
            Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk milk and eggs. 
            Add cooked macaroni, 2 cups extra-sharp 
            Cheddar, melted butter, 1 & 1/2 teaspoons salt 
            and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and stir until well 
            combined.</li>
        <li>Add half the macaroni mixture to a 
            9-by-13-inch baking dish in an even layer. 
            Sprinkle 1½ cups Colby Jack evenly on top. 
            Spread the remaining macaroni mixture on 
            top in an even layer. Cover with aluminum 
            foil, transfer to the middle rack of the 
            oven and bake for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven. Carefully remove and 
            discard the aluminum foil. Top the 
            macaroni mixture with the remaining 2 
            cups Cheddar and 1/2 cup Colby Jack. 
            Broil on top rack until cheese is browned 
            in spots, 3 to 5 minutes. (The broiled 
            cheese can go from golden to burnt fairly 
            quickly, so keep a close eye on it.)</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and let cool until the 
            macaroni and cheese is fully set, 10 to 
            15 minutes. (The mixture may first appear 
            jiggly, but it will firm up as it cools.) 
            Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
