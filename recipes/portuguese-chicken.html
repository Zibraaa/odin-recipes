        <h2 class="pagedesc">Description</h2>

        <p class="pagetext">This Portuguese Chicken, also known as Peri 
            Peri Chicken is one of those dishes that 
            makes winter a little more bearable. Itâ€™s 
            hearty and satisfying and warms the soul 
            with its deep smoky flavors. The prep time 
            is relatively short and the oven does much 
            of the work. During the cold months, I try 
            to utilize the oven as much as possible.</p>

        <h2 class="pagedesc">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="pagetext">
            <li>Preheat oven to 425F</li>
            <li>Rehydrate dried chilies in a small pot 
                of simmering water on the stove for 20 
                minutes. Remove stem and seeds.</li>
            <li>Butterfly the chicken: Rinse inside 
                and out, removing innards. Pat dry. 
                Place on a cutting board, breast down. 
                Using sharp kitchen scissors, cut 
                along both sides of the spine, remove 
                and discard. Turn the chicken over, 
                and placing your hand on the breast 
                bone, press down hard with the palm of 
                your hand, to flatten.</li>
            <li>Make the marinade by blending the 
                marinade ingredients into a paste with 
                a blender or food processor. Brush a 
                layer of the marinade on the bottom of 
                your large sheet pan.</li>
            <li>Place the thinly sliced potatoes on 
                top of the marinade and sprinkle with 
                a generous pinch of kosher salt,  
                overlapping slightly but not too 
                much.</li>
            <li>Brush all sides and crevasses of the 
                chicken with the marinade, coating 
                fairly heavily. (You will add more 
                marinade during cooking, so be sure 
                to save the remaining.) Place chicken, 
                skin side down on the potatoes and 
                place in the hot oven.</li>
            <li>Turn chicken over after 15 minutes, 
                and place back in the oven. After 15 
                minutes, brush more marinade all over 
                the chicken on the skin side, really 
                lathering it up. Return to the oven 
                and bake until cooked through another 
                15-30 minutes, or until leg/ thigh 
                reaches an internal temperature of 
                165 F.  The bigger the chicken, the 
                longer this will take. ( A large, 
                5-6 pound chicken may take an 
                additional 20 minutes!) To crisp 
                the skin and get it deeply brown, 
                broil for a few minutes. A little 
                char is good here!!! Remove chicken 
                when done and let rest 5-10 minutes 
                before serving. You can continue to 
                cook the potatoes or crisp them up 
                ( with broiler) while resting the 
                chicken and cutting it into pieces.</li>
            <li>While chicken is roasting, combine 
                Cilantro Sauce ingredients together, 
                either in a bowl- mixing by hand, or 
                in a food processor. Serve cilantro 
                sauce on the side.</li>
